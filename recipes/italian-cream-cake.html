  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is a cake that I have not made!</p>
  <p>I got the inspiration to look up this cake recipe from a memory of a cake from an Italian cafe. I think what was good about the cake that we ate was the texture of the cake as a whole when you bit through the sponge and moist cream</p>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease three 9-inch round cake pans.</li>    
    <li>To make the cake: Combine buttermilk and baking soda together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
    <li>Beat butter, shortening, and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in eggs, buttermilk mixture, vanilla, coconut, baking powder, and flour; stir until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared pans.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>To make the frosting (while cakes are cooling): Beat cream cheese, butter, vanilla, and confectioners' sugar in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in cream, a little at a time, to attain the desired consistency. Stir in walnuts and coconut. Spread frosting between the cake layers and on the top and sides of cooled cake.</li>
